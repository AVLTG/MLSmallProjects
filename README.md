# Machine Learning Experiments and Assignments

This repository contains a collection of my machine learning experiments and assignments. The projects in this repository are implemented in Python and cover a variety of machine learning algorithms and techniques. 
Specifically, for 311GroupStudentAbilityML, I have not included util or the dataset we used since those are owned by the university and I dont think I have the rights to share them.

## Projects

### 1. 311 Group Student Ability

The project directory contains multiple implementation of learning an algorithm to accurately predict a students ability to do well on a question
based on similar questions that they got right or wrong. Used 4 different models; KNN, IRT, Neural Network, and Matrix Factorization. Matrix Factorization is not yet implemented.

### 2. ML experiments

The ML experiments directory contains implementations of different algorithms to run on sample datasets that I made up. The algorithms include KNN, Decision Trees, Linear Regression,
Logistic Regression, Multi Layer Perceptron (Feed Forward Neural Network), and Naive Bayes Classifications. I'm most proud of the MLP.

## Setup and Installation

To run these projects, you need to have Python installed on your machine.

After installing Python, you can install the required packages using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
